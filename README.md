Here I am starting with a simple version of tic tac toe where 2 players can play the game with each other.For playing the game they need to select a number from 1 to 9 in each step representing each cell in a tic tac toe game where they want to put their 'X' or '0'.
In later versions i want to add code which will make it possible to play the game against the computer too with varying levels of difficulty.
Also in the starting the exection of the game is being done on terminal window, which i wish to change and make a simple GUI for it so that it becomes easy for the user.
