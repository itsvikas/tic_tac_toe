Most of us are familiar with the tic TIC TAC TOE game, for those who are not, it is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, 'X' and '0', who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The game is won by player who who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.


Here I am starting with a simple version of tic tac toe game which can be played on a computer, where two players can play the game with each other.For playing the game they need to select a number from 1 to 9 in each step representing each cell(one of the nine cells in a 3x3 grid) in a tic tac toe game where they want to put their 'X' or '0'.


In later versions i want to add code which will make it possible to play the game against the computer too, with varying levels of difficulty.


Also in the starting, the execution of the game is being done on terminal window, which i wish to change and make a simple GUI for it, so that it becomes easy for the user.
